## Build Projects

Before you build projects, ensure that the pack index on your local computer is up-to-date with the command.

```txt
> cpackget update-index        
```

The project files  contain a list of software packs that are used. When using the `cbuild` tool option `--packs` these packs are downloaded during the build process as shown in the following example command line:

```txt
> cbuild Hello.csolution.yml --packs --rebuild
```
