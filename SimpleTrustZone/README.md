# Simple TrustZone Application

This ARM Cortex-M33 secure/non-secure example project that shows the setup for TrustZone for ARMv8-M applications.

The application uses CMSIS and can be executed on an Arm Virtual Hardware (AVH).

The application demonstrates function calls between secure and non-secure state.

Secure application:

- Setup code and start non-secure application.

Non-secure application:

- Calls a secure function from non-secure state.
- Calls a secure function that call back to a non-secure function.

Output:
Variables used in this application can be viewed in the uVision Debugger Watch window.
